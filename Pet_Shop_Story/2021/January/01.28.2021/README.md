# Game not functional - January 28th 2021

My phone was recently force-updated to Android 11. Some apps stopped working due to this. Pet Shop story is one of the 7 games I normally play on Thursdays that is not functional. The game is not able to get past the loading screen, even after a 30+ second wait.

Due to the way these games are updated, it is highly unlikely that I will ever be able to play this game again.
  
It is the second game I have found to not work on Android 11. The first game to stop functioning was Tiny Tower.
