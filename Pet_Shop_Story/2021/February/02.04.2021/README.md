# Pet Shop Story functionality is back - February 4th 2021

I got back to the usual check-in for this game today. Last week, I was unable to, due to a bug in Android 11. For some reason, after the update and as of February 4th 2021, 2 apps lost functionality from the update, crashing upon loading, but have since gained their functionality back as of today, February 4th 2021. I am not entirely sure what caused it or how they recovered, but both apps work again now, but I haven't been able to get back into Tiny Tower yet.

I was surprised that out of the 6 teamlava games that I play, pet shop story was the one that had issues, noting that I would have thought Bakery Story would have had problems, since the app was crashing a few seconds after the last popup on the first load of the week, and Farm Story has gotten stuck in the background before and used 40-70% of the phones CPU until put to sleep twice (only happened on Android 7 and 8, hasn't occurred yet in Android 10 or 11) it wasn't too big of a loss, as I haven't been able to do much in the game for a while lately.

I am still working on trying to expand with the newer expansions, but there isn't much to do, since I can't log in again after 8 hours to finish stuff before the pets are "euthanized" or "get sick" this game is not possible to progress in very well when you play on a once a week (once every ~168 hours) basis.

All I have been doing weekly in this game is checking in, requesting permits for expansion (most of my neighbors are inactive, so it is going to take a long time to get to 40) collecting and feeding pets, and checking xp.
